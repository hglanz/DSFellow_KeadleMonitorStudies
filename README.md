## Goals/Tasks

1. Learn about and understand Hidden Markov Models
2. Reproduce at least one HMM example from the readings above.
* Specify the model, including parameter values.
* Simulate data from this model.
* Estimate the parameters of the model based only on the data.
* Assess closeness to actual parameter values.

3. Draw the diagram for and explain how the wearable monitor data can be modeled with an HMM.
4. Re-do 2. in the context of fake wearable monitor situation. 

* Specify a model that resembles (possibly in a much more simplified way) our wearable monitor situation, including model parameter values.
* Simulate data from this model.
* Estimate the parameters of the model based on the data.
* Assess closeness to actual parameter values.

5. Apply HMMs to the actual wearable monitor data.
6. Compare HMM model results and performance to the performance of other models.
7. Write up work and results.
